# Algorithm Design and Analysis
The exploration, design, analysis of multiple algorithms and its possible applications. The importance of algorithms is discussed here.

Here's how to get you started on copying all of the below tutorial codes. Run the below code to clone this repository onto your local computer.  
`git clone https://github.com/cheewoei1997/dijkstras-algorithm.git`

Once you've cloned, just navigate to the folder that you have cloned and you're all set. Or you could just download it as a zip file.

## Report
[Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBP5YthUArdHzuwBgMLLnY_c2a7Owu4Fre75FPwws_w/edit?usp=sharing). This is where we discuss the applications of Dijkstra's algorithm and its possibilities.

## Slides
[Click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10T7bEN9gTz4k7sUCgPKQM9qSyPP0G3n4_CIVblF9Sek/edit?usp=sharing). Simple slides to give the audience an idea about the implementation of Dijkstra's algoritm.

## Setting Up
#### Step 1
It is suggested that you use a virtualenv with Python 3.5 to make things easier. In the case that you have multiple python files, just run the code below.  
```pip install virtualenv```  
```virtualenv -p /path/to/python/python35 --distribute venv```

#### Step 2
Make sure to install all the dependencies involved in this project by running the code below. Or you can acquire the necessary libraries and download them manually.  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Step 3
To set this project up this library is not essentially needed, but more of a preference. Download the [Graphviz library](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html).

#### Step 4
Navigate to the same folder as where the file ```dijkstra-algo.py``` resides, then run ```python dijkstras-algo.py```on your command line interface (CLI).
