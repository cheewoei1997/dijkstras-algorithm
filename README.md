# Algorithm Design and Analysis
The exploration, design, analysis of multiple algorithms and its possible applications. The importance of algorithms is discussed here.

Here's how to get you started on copying all of the below tutorial codes. Run the below code to clone this repository onto your local computer.  
`git clone https://github.com/cheewoei1997/dijkstras-algorithm.git`

Once you've cloned, just navigate to the folder that you have cloned and you're all set. Or you could just download it as a zip file.


## Report
[Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBP5YthUArdHzuwBgMLLnY_c2a7Owu4Fre75FPwws_w/edit?usp=sharing). This is where we discuss the applications of Dijkstra's algorithm and its possibilities.


## Slides
[Click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10T7bEN9gTz4k7sUCgPKQM9qSyPP0G3n4_CIVblF9Sek/edit?usp=sharing). Simple slides to give the audience an idea about the implementation of Dijkstra's algoritm.

## How To Run
Simply make sure that python is installed in your computer, navigate to the folder where the file ```dijkstra-algo.py``` resides, then run ```python dijkstras-algo.py```on your command line interface (CLI).
